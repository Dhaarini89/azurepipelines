An End to End Data Engineering project using Azure tools:(As part of Udacity Course)

Project Overview:
The City of New York would like to develop a Data Analytics platform on Azure Synapse Analytics to accomplish two primary objectives:
  1. Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
  2. Make the data available to the interested public to show how the City‚Äôs budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees.

The aim of this project is to create high-quality data pipelines that are dynamic, can be automated, and monitored for efficient operation. 
The project team also includes the city‚Äôs quality assurance experts who will test the pipelines to find any errors and improve overall data quality.
