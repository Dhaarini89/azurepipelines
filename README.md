The project is  to develop a Data Analytics platform on Azure Synapse Analytics to accomplish two primary objectives:
 Analyze how the City's financial resources are allocated and how much of the City's budget is being devoted to overtime.
 Make the data available to the interested public to show how the Cityâ€™s budget is being spent on salary and overtime pay for all municipal employees.

In this project,I was able to work with multiple Azure resources:
Azure Data Lake Gen2
Azure SQL DB
Azure Data Factory
Azure Synapse Analytics
Uploaded the CSV data to a blob container;
Created the Linked Services.
Created Datasets for the files in the data lake and in SQL DB.
Created Data Flows to load all data into the requested resources.
Used DataFlow to aggregate data, filter and create a new column, and persist the result on a new table.
